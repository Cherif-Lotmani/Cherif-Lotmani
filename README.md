## My Journey 🛤️

My journey into the tech world officially began in August 2020 when I joined The Arabic Free to Learn initiative. Thanks to a non-profit organization in Dubai called One Million Arab Coders, I gained valuable skills and earned a Front-end Web Development certificate. 🎓 This was just the start of my epic adventure!

From 2021 to 2022, I embarked on a thrilling quest to create my very own 2D video game using C# and Unity Engine. 🎮 It wasn't always smooth sailing - I had to rebuild the game not once, but twice, to make it truly shine. But hey, every setback was a lesson learned, and I emerged stronger and wiser in the end!

Now, armed with my trusty skills and boundless enthusiasm, I've established my own corporation. 🌟 With my mission to make a difference in the tech world, I'm determined to make my voice heard loud and clear, spreading knowledge and inspiration to tech enthusiasts across the globe!
